## Project Name: Ambient Dreams

## Project Description:
The goal of this project is to create a VST plugin for use with DAWs (Digital Audio Workstation). The plugin will be an ambient synth pad to aid in music production and live performances. It will provide functionality for every key and grant the user control over key/pitch, tone, shape and others.
